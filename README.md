# Advent of Code
Some programming fun over the holiday season. I am *positive* I will never crack the top 100 leader board so my only
goal is to learn and become better at programming.

## Lessons Learned
My notes on language-specific items I've learned:
* [Go Lessons Learned](lessons_learned/go.md)
* [Python Lessons Learned](lessons_learned/python.md)
